Voice recorder with local offline speech-to-text transcription.

## Code Review
- Records 10s of audio from microphone → saves as `recording.wav`
- Transcribes using faster-whisper (CPU, offline) → saves to `transcription.txt`
- Uses `base` model (good balance for Surface laptops)
- Adjustable: recording time, model size (tiny/base/small/medium/large-v3)

## Windows Setup (from scratch)

1. **Install Python 3.9+**
   - Download from python.org
   - ✓ Check "Add Python to PATH" during install

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```cmd
   pip install numpy sounddevice scipy faster-whisper
   ```

3. **Run**
   ```cmd
   python main.py
   ```

**First run**: Downloads whisper model (~140MB for base), then runs offline.

**Troubleshooting**:
- If microphone access denied: Settings → Privacy → Microphone → allow Python
- Model sizes: `tiny` (fastest) to `large-v3` (most accurate). Edit `MODEL_SIZE` in main.py
